# Gaga

Gaga is an online simple planning poker app built in [Elixir][urls.elixir],
using [Phoenix][urls.phoenix] and [LiveView][urls.live-view].

It's free, open source, and doesn't require signing up nor store any data about
you or your team (it doesn't even have a DB).

You can try it live on https://gaga.labvoid.com.

## ❓ Why?

Most of us are working from home due to the coronavirus outbreak.

While many tools already exist to keep us connected through video conferencing,
we also needed a simple collaborative app that makes it easy to estimate and
plan iterations while working remotely.

As it might help other teams and doesn't consume many resources, we decided to
make it available for everyone.
